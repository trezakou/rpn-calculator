# Improvements and shortcuts:

    - Logging should be implemented

    - Some useful endpoints should be added like:
        - delete all stacks
        - delete last element from stack, or any element based on position
    
    - Replace the SQLite db with a more robust, production ready db like PostgreSQL
    
    - The developement environment is very minimal, some useful additions should be implemented like linting, pre-commit and poetry before continuing features development

    - Calculator logic should be put in its own file not with the views
